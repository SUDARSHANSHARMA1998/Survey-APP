# Survey-APP
A Data Collector + Survey Emailer Web App with PostgreSQL, Flask, and Heroku
It is a web application that was built with Python and Flask and also we're using a PostgreSQL database in here to store data and then we use Heroku to
deploy the application online( https://datastatistics.herokuapp.com/ ) .In this app what I did is I'm asking the users or visitors to enter their email address and their height and what the application will do is one it won't want to get this pair of
data from the user, it sends the data to the database to the server and then it calculates the basic stats on heights for all the users that have been submitting data so far and then it sends these stats to the user that just submitted their email address, so it sends the stats by email to the user so all this is
automatic.
Once that is successful the user will be sent to a success page so they get the confirmation that their submission was successful and then the user will get an email to their email address
